# MaSS (Minimalistic and Simplistic Shell) (renamed due to confusion)
# A revamped version of RCMSH 
With this project I have decided to stray from the branding of RCS, and decided to give it an actual name.
# Whats New
* I have rebuilt the original shell from the ground up
* Tokenization (you can have as many args as you want)
* Faster (probably idk)
# What does this mean for RCS? 
Personally I think I'll start to shy away from relying on the base libraries, and start making better software. Which means I'll have to change the name soon
